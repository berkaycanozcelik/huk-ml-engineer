# Testing Overview

## Unit Tests
The application includes unit tests for the FastAPI endpoints, located in `tests/test_main.py`. These tests validate the basic functionality of the API, ensuring that endpoints return the expected responses for given inputs.

## Work in Progress
### Service Tests
- **Status**: Planned
- **Description**: Service tests will be implemented to verify the interaction between the FastAPI application and the underlying services (e.g., the sentiment model). These tests will ensure that the model correctly handles inputs and returns accurate predictions.

### Integration Tests
- **Status**: Planned
- **Description**: Integration tests will be developed to evaluate the end-to-end functionality of the application, including the loading of the model and weights, as well as the prediction logic. These tests will help ensure that all components work together as intended.

---

**Note**: The implementation of these tests is currently in progress. As the project evolves, these tests will be added to improve code quality and reliability.
