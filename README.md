# HUK-Coburg Engineering Challenge: Machine Learning Model Deployment

This repository demonstrates the deployment of a sentiment analysis model from Kaggle's Tweet Sentiment Extraction Competition into a production-ready microservice.

## Features
- **FastAPI Web Service**: Provides an API for model inference.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Model inference encapsulated in a Python class.
- **Dockerization**: The solution is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests and integration tests for core functionalities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Concepts for measuring and improving request latency.

## Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Docker**
- **pytest**
- **Uvicorn**

This project highlights practical skills in Machine Learning Engineering, model deployment, and microservice architecture.
