# Latency Improvement Strategies for the `/predict` Endpoint

This document outlines several strategies to improve the latency of the `/predict` endpoint in the FastAPI application. Implementing these techniques can enhance the performance and scalability, especially when handling multiple prediction requests.

## 1. Model Optimization
Utilize techniques such as:
- **Quantization**: Reduces the model size by lowering the precision of the calculations, leading to faster inference times.
- **Pruning**: Removes unnecessary weights from the model that contribute little to the prediction accuracy, resulting in a lighter model that can make predictions faster.

## 2. Batching of Requests
- **Description**: Process multiple input texts in a single request instead of handling them one at a time.
- **Benefit**: Reduces overhead by leveraging the model's ability to predict on multiple samples simultaneously, optimizing CPU/GPU utilization.

## 3. Asynchronous Processing
- **Description**: Implement asynchronous request handling for the `/predict` endpoint using FastAPI's async capabilities.
- **Benefit**: Allows the server to handle multiple prediction requests concurrently, improving responsiveness during high-load scenarios.

## 4. Utilize High-Performance Hardware
- **Description**: If deploying in a cloud environment, consider hosting the model on GPUs or TPUs.
- **Benefit**: Significantly reduces the time taken for predictions, especially for large models.
